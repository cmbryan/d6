# Frontend React Application

This is the frontend for the d6-api project, built using React. It serves as the user interface for interacting with the API.

## Getting Started

To get started with the frontend application, follow these steps:

1. **Install dependencies:**
   Make sure you have Node.js installed. Then run:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. **Run the application:**
   Start the development server with:

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

   This will open the application in your default web browser at `http://localhost:3000`.

## Project Structure

- `public/`: Contains static files like `index.html` and `manifest.json`.
- `src/`: Contains the React components and styles.
  - `components/`: Contains the main React components.
  - `index.css`: Global styles for the application.
  - `index.js`: Entry point for the React application.

## Build

To create a production build of the application, run:

```bash
npm run build
```

This will generate a `build` folder with optimized files for deployment.
